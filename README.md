Recipe to make bag

Translations

Allow custom renaming :)

Give each bag its own activator object? which brings up a settings Message?
(or just use UIListMenu) for choosing options including renaming it

Verify we put it into a clothing slot that (a) won't get in the way
                                           (b) is really free for use
